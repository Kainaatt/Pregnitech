[Key Developments]
- Fertilization occurs when sperm meets and enters the egg in the fallopian tube.
- A zygote forms and begins rapid cell division immediately.
- The dividing cells form a structure called a blastocyst within a few days.
- The blastocyst travels down the fallopian tube toward the uterus.
- Implantation into the uterine lining typically happens around day 6–12.
- Once implanted, the pregnancy officially begins as hCG production starts.
- hCG hormone signals the body to stop menstruation.
- The placenta begins forming to nourish the baby throughout pregnancy.
- The embryo forms three main cell layers that become organs later.
- Neural tube (early brain & spine) begins forming very early.
- Early heart structures start to form and may begin beating by week 5.
- Amniotic sac forms around the embryo as a protective environment.
- Amniotic fluid increases gradually to cushion the tiny embryo.
- Yolk sac forms to provide early nutrients before the placenta fully functions.
- Umbilical cord begins forming to connect embryo with placenta.
- Hormones rise quickly causing major physical changes in the mother.
- Uterus lining thickens to support embryo growth.
- Cells begin organizing into head, body, and early organ structures.
- Facial features start forming at a microscopic level.
- Blood circulation pathways begin to develop.
- Mother may not yet know she is pregnant while major development occurs.
- Baby's approximate size reaches about a poppy seed by week 4.
- Genes from both parents determine early traits like hair and eye color.
- Rapid growth makes the first month critical for health.
- Early spinal development requires folic acid to prevent neural tube defects.
- Baby’s circulatory system is among the earliest to develop.
- Pregnancy hormones protect the uterine lining from shedding.
- The embryo is extremely sensitive to toxins at this stage.
- The early brain starts forming within the first 2-3 weeks.
- Baby’s sex is determined at fertilization but cannot be seen yet.
- Maternal immune system begins adjusting to protect pregnancy.
- Hormones increase blood flow to uterus for nourishment.
- Cells specialize into bones, muscles, and skin layers later.
- Important organs start as tiny buds at this stage.
- Tiny limb buds start forming in week 5’s beginning.
- Although tiny, the baby is growing rapidly each day.
- The first month lays the foundation for all future development.
- Successful implantation is key to a sustained pregnancy.
- Mother’s lifestyle during this month strongly impacts embryo development.
- Pregnancy is confirmed biologically before any visible symptoms appear.

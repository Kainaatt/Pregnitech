[Key Developments]
- The baby is undergoing a massive period of weight gain, accumulating fat rapidly.
- This fat is crucial for regulating the baby's body temperature after birth.
- The baby's skin becomes less translucent and more opaque as fat fills out.
- The lanugo (fine body hair) begins to shed from the baby's body.
- The vernix caseosa (protective coating) thickens, especially in skin folds.
- The baby's bones are fully developed but remain soft and pliable for birth.
- The baby's brain is developing at an extraordinary rate, forming complex connections.
- The brain can now control breathing and regulate body temperature more effectively.
- The baby's eyes are now fully developed, with pupils that can dilate in response to light.
- The baby practices focusing their eyes inside the womb.
- The baby's hearing is fully mature, and they recognize and are soothed by your voice.
- The baby may respond to familiar stories or songs read or sung repeatedly.
- The baby's lungs are the last major organs to mature, producing more surfactant.
- Surfactant is a substance that prevents the lungs from collapsing at birth.
- The baby practices breathing movements, inhaling and exhaling amniotic fluid.
- The baby's kicks and jabs may feel different—more like rolls and stretches.
- This is due to the baby having less room to move as they grow larger.
- The baby's movements may feel stronger and sometimes uncomfortable.
- The baby may settle into a head-down position, if they haven't already.
- The baby's approximate length reaches about 15.5-17 inches (crown to heel).
- The baby's approximate weight reaches about 2.5-4 pounds.
- The baby's size is often compared to a coconut or a butternut squash.
- The baby spends most of its time in sleep cycles, including REM sleep.
- The baby may dream, as brain activity is high during REM cycles.
- The baby's five senses are all now operational.
- The baby's immune system is receiving antibodies from you to build protection.
- The baby's head is growing to accommodate the rapidly developing brain.
- The baby's skull bones are not fused, allowing them to overlap during birth (molding).
- The baby's fingernails have grown to the tips of their fingers.
- The baby may scratch themselves inside the womb.
- The baby's hair on the head may be growing thicker.
- The baby's body is becoming more proportional, looking like a newborn.
- The baby has less room for somersaults but will still stretch and push.
- You may feel limbs poking out as distinct bumps across your abdomen.
- The uterus is now about 5 inches above your navel.
- Your organs are significantly compressed to make space.
- The baby's position puts increasing pressure on your bladder and pelvis.
- The baby drops lower in the pelvis in preparation for birth (lightening).
- Lightening can happen this month or in the final weeks for first-time mothers.
- The baby's chances of survival outside the womb are now very high with medical care.

[When to Call the Doctor]

- Any vaginal bleeding or a trickle or gush of fluid from the vagina.
- Severe or persistent abdominal pain.
- A significant decrease in the baby's movements (do a kick count and call if concerned).
- Severe, persistent headaches that won't go away.
- Visual disturbances: blurriness, seeing spots or flashes of light.
- Sudden, significant swelling in the hands, feet, or face.
- Pain or burning during urination, which could indicate a UTI.
- Fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher.
- Excessive itching all over the body, especially on the palms and soles.

[FAQ]
- Why are the baby's movements changing? The baby has less room, so jabs turn into rolls and stretches. The pattern is more important than the type.
- What if my baby is still breech? Many babies turn head-down by 32-34 weeks. Your provider will monitor this.
- How do I time contractions? Time from the start of one to the start of the next. Note their length and intensity.
- Is it normal to feel so much pressure? Yes, as the baby descends into the pelvis, pressure on the bladder, rectum, and pelvis increases.
- Can I still travel? Most doctors advise against long-distance travel after 36 weeks. Check with your provider.
- What's the difference between Braxton Hicks and real labor? Real contractions get longer, stronger, and closer together. Braxton Hicks are irregular and don't intensify.
- When should I go to the hospital? Your provider will give specific instructions, often when contractions are 5-1-1 (5 mins apart, 1 minute long, for 1 hour).

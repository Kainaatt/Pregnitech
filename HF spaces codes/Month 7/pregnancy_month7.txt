[FAQ]
- Why am I so short of breath? Your uterus is pushing up against your diaphragm, limiting lung expansion.

- Is it normal to leak urine? Yes, pressure on the bladder is intense. Do Kegels to strengthen muscles.
- Can the baby hear me? Yes, their hearing is fully developed. Talk and read to your baby.
- Why do I have so much heartburn? Hormones relax the digestive valve, and the baby is crowding your stomach.

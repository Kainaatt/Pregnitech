[Key Developments]
- The baby is primarily focused on gaining weight, putting on about half a pound per week.
- Fat deposits smooth out the baby's skin, giving them a rounder, newborn appearance.
- The vernix caseosa (waxy coating) is mostly gone, absorbed by the skin or shed into the amniotic fluid.
- Most of the lanugo (fine body hair) has shed, though some may remain on shoulders and back.
- The baby's lungs are the last organs to mature, producing large amounts of surfactant.
- Surfactant allows the air sacs in the lungs to inflate easily and prevents collapse.
- The baby's brain is undergoing a final growth spurt, forming billions of new connections.
- Brain development is now focused on refining functions for life outside the womb.
- The baby's head may engage or "drop" into the mother's pelvis (lightening).
- Engagement can happen weeks before labor or during labor itself.
- The baby's movements are more restricted but should remain strong and regular.
- You'll feel more rolls, stretches, and wiggles than sharp kicks.
- The baby's bones are hardening, but the skull remains soft and pliable for birth.
- The skull bones are not fused, allowing them to overlap (mold) during passage through the birth canal.
- The baby's digestive system is ready to process breast milk or formula.
- Meconium (the baby's first stool) is accumulating in the intestines.
- The baby's immune system is receiving a final boost of antibodies from the mother.
- This provides passive immunity for the first few months of life.
- The baby's nails have grown long and may reach beyond the fingertips.
- The baby may scratch their face inside the womb or after birth.
- The baby's eyes are fully developed; they can perceive light, focus, and track.
- Irises are now blue or dark gray; true eye color may not be set for months.
- The baby can distinguish between different sounds and recognizes the mother's voice.
- The baby's approximate length reaches about 17-20 inches (crown to heel).
- The baby's approximate weight reaches about 5-9 pounds (varies significantly).
- The baby's size is often compared to a watermelon, pumpkin, or large squash.
- The baby practices breathing, sucking, and swallowing movements constantly.
- Hiccups are very common as the diaphragm matures.
- The baby spends about 95% of its time in sleep cycles.
- The baby's kidneys are fully functional, producing about a pint of urine daily.
- The baby's heart rate is about 110-160 beats per minute.
- The placenta is at full maturity and may begin to calcify, which is normal.
- Amniotic fluid volume begins to decrease as the baby takes up more space.
- The uterus is now up under the rib cage, crowding all internal organs.
- The baby typically settles into a head-down position by 36 weeks if not earlier.
- About 3-4% of babies remain in a breech (bottom-down) position.
- The baby is considered full-term at 39 weeks, with all organs ready for life outside.
- The baby's due date is an estimate; only about 5% of babies are born exactly on their due date.

[When to Call the Doctor/Go to Hospital]

[FAQ]
- How will I know I'm in labor? True labor contractions get longer, stronger, and closer together. They don't go away with rest or hydration.
- What is the mucus plug? A thick plug of mucus that seals the cervix. Losing it means labor could be hours, days, or weeks away.
- What if my water breaks but I don't have contractions? Call your provider; you'll likely need to go to the hospital to prevent infection.
- How can I naturally induce labor? Walking, nipple stimulation, acupressure, and dates may help, but always check with your doctor first.
- What if I go past my due date? Your provider will monitor you and the baby closely and discuss induction around 41 weeks.
- When should we go to the hospital? Follow your provider's specific instructions, typically when contractions meet the 5-1-1 rule.
- What if I can't get an epidural in time? Your body is designed for this; you are stronger than you think. Use your breathing techniques.
